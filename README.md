# Canbemini 
Easily create Kanbans in a moment.

# **Table of Contents**

## Introduction:
Canbemini is an easy-to-use tool for creating Kanbans in a moment. With a simple user interface, you can quickly set up and configure your Kanbans for different process flows. Canbemini also allows for shared access and manipulation of notes by multiple users, as well as control of access and sharing with coworkers. In addition to these key features, Canbemini offers swimlanes for state management, attachments to notes, and shared roles such as owner, editor, and viewer. Try Canbemini now to streamline your workflows and improve collaboration with your team.

## Features

### Key Features
 * Easy creation and configuration of Kanbans with a simple user interface.
 * Shared access to Kanbans with other users and manipulation of notes (text cards) by all users.
 * Control of access to Kanbans and sharing with coworkers to work privately with a selected group of people.
 * Attachments to each note to add additional information.
 * Shared roles in Kanbans such as owner, editor, and viewer to control who can modify or delete notes and swimlanes.

### Additional Features

 ## Prerequisites

 To run and use Canbemini, you will need the following:

A computer with a compatible operating system (such as Windows, macOS, or Linux).
A compatible version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
A compatible version of Gradle installed on your computer.
A compatible version of Node.js installed on your computer.

You will also need a web browser installed on your computer to access the application through the browser. It is recommended to use an up-to-date version of a popular web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- [Gradle 7.6](https://gradle.org/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) --> [download node.js 18.12.1 LTS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.12.1/node-v18.12.1-x64.msi)

You will also need a web browser installed on your computer to access the application through the browser. It is recommended to use an up-to-date version of a popular web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.

## Working of the project

Canbemini is a web application built using a combination of Spring Boot and Angular. It uses a [H2 Data Base](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) to store data and [JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) for data persistence.

The application consists of a backend API built with [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and a frontend built with [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular). The backend handles all the logic for storing and retrieving data from the database, while the frontend is responsible for displaying the data to the user and handling user interactions.

The frontend communicates with the backend through a series of RESTful API endpoints. When a user performs an action, such as creating a new Kanban or moving a note, the frontend sends a request to the appropriate API endpoint on the backend. The backend then performs the necessary logic and returns a response to the frontend, which is used to update the user interface.

The application also uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started) for its user interface components, such as buttons, forms, and tables. This helps to provide a consistent and visually appealing user experience.

In terms of security, the application uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](https://jwt.io/introduction) for authentication and authorization. When a user logs in, the backend generates a JWT and sends it back to the frontend, which is then stored in local storage. The frontend then sends this JWT with each subsequent request to the backend, which is used to verify the user's identity and authorize their actions. The JWT is stored in local storage instead of a cookie to prevent it from being accessed by third parties.

The application also has role-based access control, which allows the owner of a Kanban to invite collaborators and control their level of access. There are three roles: owner, editor, and collaborator. Owners have full control over the Kanban and can invite and remove collaborators, change their roles, and delete the Kanban itself. Editors have the same permissions as owners, except they cannot delete the Kanban or change the role of a user to owner. Collaborators can only move notes and swimlanes within the Kanban. This helps to ensure that only authorized users can make changes to the Kanban.

## Installation Guide

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- [Gradle 7.6](https://gradle.org/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) --> [download node.js 18.12.1 LTS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.12.1/node-v18.12.1-x64.msi)

### Running the application

To run the Canbemini application, follow these steps:

*  [Clone](https://github.com/ThePhrontistery/Canbemini.git) this repository onto your computer.
* Make sure you are using JDK 17 and Gradle 7.6.

- Open a terminal.
 * Install necessary dependencies: npm install
 * Run the project: ng serve
 * Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:4200 to see the application in action.

You can also run the Canbemini Spring Boot application as follows:

- Open a terminal in canbemini/api.
 * Run the following command: gradle bootRun. [More info about bootRun](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#running-your-application)
 * This will start the Spring Boot application and make it available at http://localhost:8080.


## Using the aplication

**To use the Canbemini application, follow these steps:**

* Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:4200.
* Click on the blue "Login" button located in the center of the screen.

## TESTING

The application has been tested with end-to-end tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/how-it-works/). 

**The following functionality has been tested:**

-**Login:** error messages on the login form, displaying the password on the form, clicking the "remember me" button, logging out, and logging in with multiple users.</br>
-**Kanbans:** the existence of a kanban, creating a new kanban, displaying error messages on the creation form, clicking on a kanban, entering and exiting a kanban to the main page, changing roles (one saving and one exiting), deleting a kanban (accepting and canceling), generating the sharing link, editing a kanban (accepting and canceling).</br>
-**Notes:** verifying that at least one note exists in a specific swimlane, modifying a note, deleting a note (accepting and canceling), adding a note, clicking the attach button on a note.</br>
-**Swimlanes:** adding a swimlane, verifying error messages, editing a swimlane (accepting and canceling), deleting a swimlane (accepting and canceling).</br>
-**Attachment:**  the following functionality has been tested and confirmed to work: uploading files (including .jpg, .pdf, and .txt), downloading, viewing (pdf only properly), and deleting attachments.

* *Currently in development:* Despite several attempts, testing for drag and drop functionality for both swimlanes and notes has not been successful. The .drag() and .triggers() functions have been attempted but have not produced the desired outcome.

**To test the application with Cypress on your computer**, you need to [install Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress), and then run the Cypress tests by executing the command 'npm test run' in your terminal. (Remember to run the command 'ng serve' to launch the UI and the command 'gradle bootRun' to launch the API before running the Cypress tests)
